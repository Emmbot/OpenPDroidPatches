=================

Framework patches for PDroid2.0 and PDroidManager

Based on the original Pdroid patches by syvat and brought upwards to jellybean by pastime1971 and myself. 

Improved and expanded by CollegeDev.

Used to patch Android 4.1.2 framework, permission management can be done with PDroid2.0 and
PDroidManager.

Works on CM10 and AOKP

PDroid itself was licensed under the GNU GPLv3. I plan to resolve some lingering license concerns and provide a license with
this repo shortly.
